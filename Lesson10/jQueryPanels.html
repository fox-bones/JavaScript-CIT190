        <h1>Facts about Koalas</h1>
        <button class="accordion">Fact #1</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The word "koala" is thought to originate from one of the Australian Aboriginal languages, 
                Dharug, which roughly translates to ‘no drink’ or ‘no water’.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Fact #2</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Koalas are folivore specialists, feeding mainly on Eucalyptus leaves, and occasional leaves of other plant species. The koala’s digestive system is particularly good at tolerating its toxic eucalyptus diet, which, even in small amounts, can often be 
                poisonous and fatal to most animals when ingested.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Fact #3</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>There is only one species of Koala in the world. It is the only extant member of the family Phascolarctidae, whose closest living relatives are the common wombats. Their wild numbers are estimated to be around 300,000 mature individuals, but showing a declining population trend.
                 Koalas are currently listed as vulnerable by the IUCN.</p>
